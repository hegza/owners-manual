= Overview of My Role and Responsibilities

No one seems to know.

My self set priorities are to
- work on engaging things,
- maintain the livelihood of the team

= Communication Preferences

- *If you'd like a quick response as soon as possible:* use Signal for work
  related communications. I'm reachable also via Teams but I look at it less often, due
  to accessibility issues.
- *If you'd like a well thought-out response:* use email, or open an issue in a repository and ping me. I reserve time every week to respond to email and issues. If I find the question hard to answer, I may procrastinate on it for a month or more, but #text(style: "italic", [I will never forget]).

I read my IMs daily, and email at least once a week (currently on Friday). I tend to
read my instant messengers (IM) only when I'm ready to respond, so don't worry about bothering me at a bad time, or if there's a bit of a delay.

= Meeting Preferences

I follow relatively strictly a subset of the
#link("https://intra.tuni.fi/fi/henkilostoasiat/tyohyvinvointi/sujuva-tietotyo")[the 2022 wellbeing
  at work recommendations by the university]:

+ *45 min meetings* for brief face-to-face issues --- Meetings are truncated such that there's always a guaranteed 15 min break
  between two consecutive meetings. For me, this allows for transitions and note literation &
  preparation. If 45 minutes is not enough, reserve 2 h 45 min and find a room on
  #link("https://resourcebooker-tuni.scientia.com/")[resource booker], so that we can make sure to
  make the time count, and so that I can plan my day around it.
+ *1 h 45 min workshops/collaboration*, starting :15 past the hour.
+ *Full day* starting at 9:15 for getting serious work done.
+ *No meetings Friday* --- Avoid meetings on Friday to guarantee weekly uninterrupted time for deep
  work. I've found this to be instrumental for my mental health.
- Notably, I'm almost always 1-5 minutes late. My time-optimistic brain is unfixable.

Additionally, I recommend the following:

- *Use O365 Calendar / Teams for scheduling.* It's bad software but it is enforced and mostly automated by the university so I don't have to work too much to get it visble on my calendar.
- *Schedule meetings at least 24 hours in advance, preferably during the previous week.* to guarantee that I can hold appropriate space.
- *Set the agenda for the meeting in the invitation.* What problems do we aim to solve with the
  meeting? Maybe I get prepared, work on it in advance or even fix the issue without the meeting.
- *Think, whether a live or a remote meeting is more appropriate.* See O365 Calendar for when I plan
  to be on campus, when on remote. If there's no information, assume that I'm remote.

- *I try to work on one main thing per day*, and address small issues in the evening. That means I might not push a project forward in 3 weeks, and then I suddenly get it done over 2 days.
