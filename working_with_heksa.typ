= Introduction
- Purpose of this Manual
- Overview of My Role and Responsibilities

= Communication Preferences

- *If you'd like a quick response as soon as possible:* use Signal for work
  related communications. I'm reachable also via Teams but I look at it less due
  to accessibility issues.
- *If you'd like a well thought-out response:* use email, or open an issue in a
  repository and ping me.

I read my IMs daily, and email at least once a week (on Thursday). I tend to
read my instant messengers (IM) only when I'm ready to respond, so don't worry
if there's a bit of a delay. I'm most engaged with communication between 12 and
17.

= Meeting Preferences

I follow strictly a subset of the
#link("https://intra.tuni.fi/fi/henkilostoasiat/tyohyvinvointi/sujuva-tietotyo")[the 2022 wellbeing
at work recommendations by the university]:

+ *45 min meetings* --- Meetings are truncated such that there's always a guaranteed 15 min break
  between two consecutive meetings. For me, this allows for transitions and note literation &
  preparation. If 45 minutes is not enough, reserve 2 h 45 min and find a room on
  #link("https://resourcebooker-tuni.scientia.com/")[resource booker], so that we can make sure to
  make the time count, and so that I can plan my day around it.
+ *No meetings Friday* --- Avoid meetings on Friday to guarantee weekly uninterrupted time for deep
  work. I've found this to be instrumental for my mental health.

Additionally, I recommend the following:

- Use O365 Calendar / Teams, and schedule meetings at least 24 hours, preferable 48 hours in advance
  to guarantee that I'll be able to hold appropriate space.
- Set the agenda for the meeting in the invitation. What problems do we aim to solve with the
  meeting?
- Think, whether a live or a remote meeting is more appropriate. See O365 Calendar for when I plan
  to be on campus, when on remote. If there's no information, assume that I'm remote.
